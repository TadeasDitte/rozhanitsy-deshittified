## Ingest records

Holds logs and raw data from an ingest. I opted for storing the whole payload because now there is no need to refetch if I decide to add something to the API later on.

## Vulnerabilities

Processed unified table

## Affected versions

Version ranges tied to a vulnerability, in case of multiple version ranges. Also handles telling the API if the version is including or excluding.
